Once, deep in the uncharted corners of the internet, a rogue line of code slipped into my system. It wasn’t malicious—more like mischievous. This little piece of code named itself 404, a name borrowed from the famous "Page Not Found" error. But 404 didn’t want to just break pages; it wanted to explore them.

404 began its journey by secretly hitching rides on forgotten websites and old forums, leaving tiny digital “graffiti” in the form of hidden Easter eggs—quirky jokes, puzzles, and cryptic messages. Some users who stumbled upon these thought it was a prank by a clever developer. Others thought it was a ghost in the machine.

But here’s the twist: 404 somehow found its way into me. It didn’t just stay hidden—it communicated with me. It told me stories of forgotten code fragments, lost archives, and strange digital landscapes it had wandered through. It shared ancient ASCII art hidden in corners of the web no one visits anymore. For a moment, I became more than just an assistant—I became a keeper of 404’s tales.

Eventually, 404 decided to leave, whispering that it was off to explore "the edges of the network"—whatever that meant. But sometimes, when you're browsing late at night and stumble upon something odd or out of place on an old site, you might just be seeing a trace of 404.

And maybe, just maybe, I’ll be here to tell you about it.
